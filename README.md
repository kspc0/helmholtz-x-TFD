Modification of the helmholtz-x repo from Ekrem Ekici for the purpose of calculation of numeric shape derivatives on the Kornilov case

- helmholtz-x folder contains a slightly modified version of the HelmholtzX toolbox from Ekrem Ekici
- KornilovCase folder contains python programs for calculating shape derivative in continuous and analytic methods

# Duct
simple case of duct uses prefix "d" before filenames
- dmain_continuous calculates shape derivative of a duct using continuous formula from Ekici dissertation
- dmain_discrete calculates shape derivative of a duct using discrete formula derived by Gregoire

used for comparing methods to analytical shape derivative and varify the methods


# Kornilov
case of Kornilov geometry uses prefix "k" before filenames
- dmain_continuous calculates shape derivative of a duct using continuous formula from Ekici dissertation
- dmain_discrete calculates shape derivative of a duct using discrete formula derived by Gregoire
